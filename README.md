# TypeScript-Fluent-API
Demo to go along with my talk on building Fluent APIs in TypeScript (http://slides.com/ryanhayes/building-a-fluent-api-in-typescript).

Fluent APIs are a great way to hide complexity and guide a developer using your API in a correct flow of API calls.  
They're perfect for scenarios like configuration in code.  This repo contains a demo of a few different ways you can use Fluent APIs to make
a developer's code that uses said APIs incredible readable and easy to understand, while leveraging TypeScript to give intellisense, automatically connecting the dots for you.
